      <p>Harmattan season is here and it is characterized by some issues like cracks in the walls. To prevent your newly painted walls from cracking or peeling so soon, you should read this</p>
      <p>GIGO! Garbage In. Garbage Out.</p>
      <p>If you were a computer science student then you must be familiar with that. What you give in is what you get. When it comes to painting and paint products, it is also true. </p>
      <p>A major cause of cracking on painted walls is the use of low quality paint products.  
        The less you pay for paint the less likely it is to stand the test of time.
        Sub-standard paint products are likely to result in peeling, cracking or chipping very easily more than a high quality one.
        Before you pay for any paint product ensure that you have done your due diligence on the quality of the brand and it's products. 
        Ask questions about a product before you spend your money on it. 
        There are very many paint brands available in the market compared to the number of quality and professional brands. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, remember that price is a deciding factor when it comes to going for best quality. 
        However, you should consider the cost of paying more now for longer lasting service than the cost of repainting in the long run when the paint cracks.  
        Using a high-quality product on a badly prepared wall will not make any difference as well.</p>  
      <p>At FIRSTKLASS PAINT & CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NIG. LTD we only produce quality paints made with the best raw materials from our suppliers.
